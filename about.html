        <h3 class="mt-3">Who is Zach?</h3>
        <p>Great question! I'm not sure. I was born and raised in the North Carolina and had a strong connection to video games. Most notably, I started
        my developer carrer with my first real plugin: ChatFeelings. Released way back in 2015, this plugin was a simple chat addition to the popular game Minecraft.
        With well over 350,000 downloads, 14 year old me was beyond hyped. From then on, I never stopped coding.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3">What can you do?</h3>
        <p>I am an experienced full-stack web developer and I occasionally bedazzle in Java & Python. I can build full desktop applications for you based off of Electron
        or I can make little scripts to add into your games. From websites, apps, plugins, and server maintence, I can take your ideas and make them a reality. Launching an app
        requires upkeep, maintence, and a really solid understanding of Linux based systems. This is incredibly overwhelming to new buissness and start ups! That's why it's important
        to have someone who's skilled, expierenced, and comfortable guiding your digital dreams.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3">Are you for hire?</h3> 
        <p>It depends on your needs! I am still a full time student with a part-time job. While I'd love to help you with your larger projects, I am currently avilable for small
        web-based or minecraft based commissions. If you have a pitch, please throw it my way on discord: Zach#3456</p>
